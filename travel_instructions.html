<div id="main">
<h3>Popup images of the original pages</h3>
<p>Throughout the diary, the page breaks which occur are rendered as 
clickable links which bring up an image of the original diary page to
which they correspond.  These links are activated on both sides of the 
diary text and when clicked, the window which contains the image appears 
on the opposite side of the window to link which was clicked.  This is so 
that one may compare the transcription or the translation to the original 
diary. </p>
<p>An example of this feature is presented <span onclick="showPage('001','engl')" class="pageLink">here</span>.</p>

<h3>Popup annotations</h3>
<p>Underlined text refers to an annotation in the back matter.  The side-by-side
diary view page pops-up annotations on mouse-over for javascript and css enabled
browsers.</p>

<h3>Quick links to sections and chapters</h3>
<p>The navigational menus at the right and left side of the page control
quick links to various points of the diary which correspond to the beginning
of new chapters and the beginning of new months in Alexander's journey.  The
original text and the translation can be controlled independently: each 
menu controls the text on its side of the window.</p>
